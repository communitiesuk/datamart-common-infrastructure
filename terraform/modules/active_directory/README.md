# Active Directory Management

## SSH tunnel

To connect to the AD servers you will first need to forward port 3389 through the SSH bastion.

For setup see the top level README, then port forward with

```sh
ssh <username>@$(terraform output -raw bastion_dns_name) -L localhost:3388:ad_management.vpc.local:3389
```

then connect with RDP to localhost:3388

## RDP to management server as directory admin

* Username: dluhcdata.local\admin
* Password: from output directory_admin_password

### RDP to CA server

If you need to connect to the CA server, RDP to the management server first and then from there RDP to the CA.

* Username: Administrator
* Password: get password data and decrypt it

## First time setup

### Install AD management tools

This should happen automatically via the instance's user data, but you can also perform the installation manually. From [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_install_ad_tools.html):

* Open `Server manager`
* Add Roles and Features
* On the "Features" page of the wizard, open up `Remote Server Administration Tools` -> `Role Administration Tools` and tick both `AD DS and AD LDS Tools` and `DNS Server Tools`

### Set up DNS forwarding

From [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/integrating-your-directory-services-dns-resolution-with-amazon-route-53-resolvers/).

RDP to the AD management server, and open up the DNS Manager application. Enter the IP address of one of the DNS servers. You can get their IP addresses from `terraform output ad_dns_servers`. Right click on "Forwarders" and ensure there is a single forwarder with the IP address of the Amazon Provided DNS server, which is the VPC's base IP address + 2, i.e. `*.*.0.2`.

Or using PowerShell

```powershell
Set-DnsServerForwarder -ComputerName <dns-server> -IpAddress x.x.0.2
```

Do the same for the other server and check that `nslookup secretsmanager.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` returns an IP address inside the VPC.

Only the management server and CA server use the Domain Controllers as DNS servers.
Other instances within the VPC use Amazon provided DNS and this module configures a private Route53 zone that points the domain (dluhcdata.local) at an NLB that forwards LDAP(S) requests to the DCs. This NLB is sticky which helps mitigate problems due to replication lag.

## Troubleshooting

### You can also connect as the ec2 server admin

* Username: `Administrator`
* Password: `ad_management_server_password` terraform output

### View SSM result

Terraform is unaware of an aws_ssm_association failing to run.

* Run `aws ssm list-commands` to see the status.
* RDP to the server to find the logs. Check under `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\SSM\Logs`

### CA Server setup

* The logs from the CA server "QuickStart" SSM document run go to CloudWatch

### Update DNS servers

You may have to update the DNS servers manually to point to the Domain Controllers as we no longer advertise them over DHCP.

Log into the server and in an admin PowerShell update:

```powershell
Get-DnsClientServerAddress
Set-DNSClientServerAddress "Ethernet 2" -ServerAddresses ("10.0.5.12", "10.0.4.251")
```

Where "Ethernet 2" matches the interface name returned by the first command and the IP addresses are the domain controller for that environment's DCs, you can get these from the `ad_dns_servers` Terraform output or the AWS console under Directory Services.

## Active Directory Migration Tool setup

Optional, but recommended:

* Make sure the AD Management Server is at least a t3.xlarge, apply that change with terraform if necessary.
* Install Firefox (note that the AD server is behind the Network Firewall, so most sites will not load)

  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest "https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest&os=win64&lang=en-US" -OutFile firefox.exe
  .\firefox.exe
  ```

### Domain setup

RDP into the AD Management Server as domain admin.

Following the instructions here: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-migrate-your-on-premises-domain-to-aws-managed-microsoft-ad-using-admt/> or [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_tutorial_setup_trust_prepare_onprem.html) for prerequisites

* Open up the security groups and ACL. Easiest to allow all traffic. DCs definitely need to be able to send DNS requests to each other.
  * Done in terraform
* Run through the other prerequisites, check Windows Firewall and that Kerberos pre-authentication enabled, was all fine on our side
* Configure conditional DNS forwarders on both sides and make sure you can resolve both domains using either AD - I'm not sure this is required for the managed side since you set them up when you create the trust, but I did it anyway
* Set the Local Security Policy for Named pipes as detailed here, I think it's the default: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/before_you_start.html>
* Set up the two-way forest trust using Active Directory Domains and Trusts on the non-managed side and the AWS console on the managed side (currently not in terraform)
* Log in as an admin of the source domain, and add the admin user of the target domain to the Administrators group (the memberOf tab is a bit buggy for this, use the members list of the group instead). You can do this from an Admin powershell:
```
$User = Get-ADUser -Identity "CN=Admin,OU=Users,OU=dluhcdata,DC=dluhcdata,DC=local" -Server "dluhcdata.local"
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity Administrators -Members $User -Server "<source domain>.local"
```
* We'll then use the target domain admin for the rest of the process, as they now have permissions across both domains
* Continue with the guide to set up PES. [Direct download link](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/1/0/a10798d3-cc25-4c32-a393-c06cd9f5d854/pwdmig.msi). Run the pwdmig.msi in admin mode (e.g. from an admin powershell terminal).

### Installation

Install SQL Server Express 2019.

```powershell
Write-Host "Downloading SQL Server Express 2019..."
$Path = $env:TEMP
$Installer = "SQL2019-SSEI-Expr.exe"
$URL = "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866658"
Invoke-WebRequest $URL -OutFile $Path\$Installer

Write-Host "Installing SQL Server Express..."
Start-Process -FilePath $Path\$Installer -Args "/ACTION=INSTALL /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS /QUIET" -Verb RunAs -Wait
Remove-Item $Path\$Installer
```

Download and install ADMT from here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56570>, direct link: <https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/1/5/9156937F-1DF7-4734-9BEB-5F0A4400B29E/admtsetup32.exe>

When it asks for a database server to use, use `.\SQLEXPRESS`.

Set up PES on the source domain, step 3 here: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-migrate-your-on-premises-domain-to-aws-managed-microsoft-ad-using-admt/>. Direct download link: <https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/1/0/a10798d3-cc25-4c32-a393-c06cd9f5d854/pwdmig.msi>

### Running ADMT

Use the scripts in manual_scripts/admt/
* Update ADMT's exclusion list so that it doesn't exclude the "mail" attribute. To do this, copy the update_exclusion.vbs script onto the server and run `c:\windows\syswow64\cscript.exe update_exclusion.vbs` from an administrator command prompt.
* Import all groups by running `get_groups.ps1` on the source DC to generate include files.
* Run an ADMT Group migration. Use the `groups-includefile.csv` include file. Target `OU=Groups,...` for both source and target domains. Select the option to include users. We import users as part of the group migration because there are too many users in production for powershell to create a users include file based on membership of datamart-delta-user
* Run another ADMT Group migration. This time use `nested-groups-includefile.csv`. Target `CN=datamart-delta,OU=Groups...`.
* Run an ADMT user migration. Use the `registration-requests-includefile.csv` include file. Target `CN=DeltaRegistrationRequests,OU=Users,...` in the target domain.
* After completing that big migration, put the correct usernames in tidy_up.ps1 and then run it. 

Make sure sap-admin is a member of `datamart-cpm-soap-api`

For E-Claims access to the CPM API, these users need to have been imported and added to the `datamart-user` group:
* In staging, `cpm-admin`
* In production, `achadmin-dclg`

Datamart service users that should be deleted if they were imported: superuser, delta-superuser, datamart-app-admin, cpm-biz-prod01, cpm-app-user, admin-dclg (has a different SAM id)

To import the OUs inside OU=Delta-Organizations:
* Run the export_delta_orgs.ps1 script on the source DC to generate an export file
* Edit the file in notepad, deleting the top entry (which refers to OU=Delta-Organizations itself)
* Copy the file to our AD management server
* Run `ldifde -i -f ous.ldf` to import it
