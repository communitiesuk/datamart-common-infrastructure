# Patching

Patching of OS-managed packages is automated using cron or AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows.

Other components (vendor application versions, Tomcat etc.) are patched manually on a schedule documented on Confluence as part of the Run Book: <https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DT/pages/3375127/Patching>
