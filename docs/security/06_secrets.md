# Secrets

See [05_terraform](./05_terraform.md) for details on the Terraform state, which contains some application secrets.

## Secrets Manager

AWS Secrets Manager is used to manage application secrets.
Some of these are directly managed or have their values accessed by Terraform,
but most must be manually created and only secret metadata is read by Terraform, with the value being read by the relevant application.

## Shared secrets

Policy: All shared production secrets, (e.g. admin passwords from MarkLogic and Active Directory), should be stored in Secrets Manager.
Exceptions only as required for disaster recovery.

Shared secrets for staging and test may be stored in a shared password vault.

## Rotation

Our rotation policy is documented on Confluence: <https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DT/pages/3375105/Secret+Rotation>
